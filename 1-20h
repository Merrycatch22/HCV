Ryan: Dear Bluffaver,Online poker needs your help. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is currently considering reversing the 2011 opinion that opened the door for state-by-state legalization of online poker.This would make it impossible or other states to follow the lead of Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware in legalizing and regulating the game. The most effective way you can help is to call the Department of Justice comment line at 202-353-1555 and them know you oppose this and believe states should have the right to regulate and legalize online poker.Once you've done that, the next step is to email Jeff Sessions' office. The Poker Players Alliance has made that as easy as two clicks right here.Don't think this couldn't happen. Any hope of having more states legalize online poker depends on you taking five minutes today to be heard.Forward this email to your friends, family, and anybody else you know that can help.Thank you,BluffAve Management
